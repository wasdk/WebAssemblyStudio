    Overview Before React.PureComponent was introduced, shallowCompare was commonly used to achieve the same functionality as
    PureRenderMixin while using ES6 classes with React. If your React component’s render function is “pure” (in other words,
    it renders the same result given the same props and state), you can use this helper function for a performance boost
    in some cases.

        sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

    shallowCompare returns true if the shallow comparison for props or state fails and therefore the component should update.
    shallowCompare returns false if the shallow comparison for props and state both pass and therefore the component does
    not need to update. Edit this page
